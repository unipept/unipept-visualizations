# Unipept visualizations

This repository contains stand-alone versions of the unipept visualizations. At this time, only the treeview is available.

A live example of this visualization can be found [on bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/bmesuere/162572f2d70c1a3a3e09)

The code can be found in the `assets` subdirectory and depends on D3 to run. 

Documentation is sparse at the moment, but the examples in the `samples` directory should be a good starting point.
